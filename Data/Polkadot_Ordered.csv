More projects are deploying dApps on Polkadot Parachains than making Parachains today and this trend will likely continue due to the high resource requirement to deploy a chain. The core problem is that the Polkadot ecosystem only supports EVM at the time of writing this and we are reproducing something which other L1s/L2s can do. One of Polkadot’s main differentiators and default environment is Wasm . In this bounty, we would like to push Wasm smart contracts adoption. The scope is as follows: 1. Create easily accessible and audited ink!/ask! smart contract showcases. 2. Create ink!ubator - an incubation program to support community projects built with ink! and parachains that want to expose select APIs through contracts-pallet  “chain extensions”. We will also help facilitate a smart contract auditing market. 3.Develop a React hooks library “useInk” - the missing front end library for Dapps on Polkadot.","Based on the importance of Ink!

124,Magnet Proposal: Polkadot’s Smart Contract Docking Station using DOT as Gas Based on the PAYG Model,development,0,Magnet,Magnet,none,1,40105.19,2023-08-22,2023-10-07,2025-03-12,,https://magnet.magport.io/,,https://twitter.com/@Magnet20239,,https://medium.com/@acaishiba,"In order to complete the use cases for DOT and enable a comprehensive user base from enterprise-level users to lightweight users, Magnet will be a smart contract platform based on the PAYG model, with DOT as the gas fee. The platform's key features are summarized as follows: 1. Magnet without Tokens: All token functions will be carried out by DOT, including contract deployment, transaction fees, governance, etc. 2. Magnet will support EVM and WASM: As EVM currently dominates the smart contract market, the first phase of development will primarily focus on EVM, followed by support for WASM smart contracts. 3. Magnet will be built on the PAYG Model: This will allow a more flexible approach to connect to the Polkadot network and obtain its security guarantees. The price difference between platform Gas fees and blockspace can also provide a certain business income for Magnet, funding its long-term operations. 4. Magnet will be developed based on Tanssi Network: Magnet will ultimately provide services to users in the form of containerchain/appchain with the support of Tanssi Network. Tanssi's support will also accelerate Magnet's development. 5. Magnet will integrate XCM: XCM will serve as the foundation for DOT's transfer to the platform, ensuring its smooth operation. 6. Income distribution: Revenues generated from operations will be distributed to the Polkadot treasury, Collators, system reserves, and project operations. Most of the income will be distributed, with Magnet retaining only the basic fees for project maintenance. ","At the moment of the proposal and even months after, there are still not much information about Magnet either on Github or other places. Only that it’s going to be developed as the premier dapp on Tanssi, the idea of a Pay As You Go token model shows promise and that it has talented developers.

We propose the implementation of nominator leaderboards – dashboards that visualize nominator behavior, offering a comprehensive view of actions and results within the system. The leaderboard allows showing the entire range of actions and results that exist in the system.","The proposer is one of the original and older parties involved in the early days of Polkadot as well as a well connected party and for that reason, motif network could become a valuable tool.

Only the twitter account linked to the proposal is active but there have not been updates about this tool. There is no reports of the progress on governance forums either. Another problem is that we don’t have a Github repository so tracking this proposal has become extremely difficult. This proposal was only possible thanks to the approval of 16DG aka Giotto as the only other big account voting was DAY7 from Nova Wallet. For that reason, it’s unclear how much progress has happened during the development of this proposal. On November 24th 2023 a new proposal appeared by the same author. MOTIV.NETWORK in the process of requesting updates about this general unavailability of this proposal, the proposer replied: “Unfortunately, the outcome of the governance process 165 (extremely toxic + public) has resulted in several team members leaving, including those involved in product and UX. I highlighted these issues during the proposal discussions and noted their impact on the team and its motivation. Therefore, immediately after the allocation of funds (3 weeks ago), we began searching for new colleagues. Currently, our new UX engineer is working on designing the dashboard.

To address this issue, it is necessary to create a true hub of French content to promote Polkadot and engage in a B2B approach to attract projects that can utilize Polkadot's technology. This approach will have five aspects: 1.A weekly newsletter on governance. 2.A monthly newsletter on ecosystem news. 3. A weekly thematic article. 4.

The inaugural launch of the Polkadot Relayers took place last year in 2022, and was successful in accomplishing its initial objective of bringing together developers and entrepreneurs, as well as providing individuals with a platform to actualise their innovative ideas. This year, the Relayers program seeks to focus on nurturing committed project teams looking for mentorship, investment, and ecosystem support whilst they build on Polkadot. The 2023 edition seeks to improve on the learnings from the Relayers program in 2022, building on participant feedback and working very closely with 7 dedicated parachain teams to create a cohesive initiative that gives back to the Polkadot ecosystem.

Ecosystem growth tool,development,0,Tokenguard,Tokenguard,none,1,25361,2023-11-20,,,,https://tokenguard.io/,,https://twitter.com/Tokenguard_io,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tokenguard-io/mycompany/,"Ink! dApp builders working in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems are one of the most important growth factor to attract new users and increase adoption of the ecosystem. We agree with the statement that: ""As a Polkadot ecosystem, we should push Ink! more(than EVM) to make Polkadot native use cases that leverage Polkadot’s technologies."" Currently, Ink! dApp builders can't easily access their smart contract data which effectively defocuses them from developing their dApps. They need to spend hundreds of hours, building and maintaining in-house analytics solutions which usually delivers almost no growth-focused insights. Therefore, to attract and support Ink! creators, we need to build solutions that will allow them to focus on growing their dApps. The Solution: Tokenguard proposes building dApp Marvels 💎 - an on-chain analytics tool designed for Ink! dApps builders to support their growth and operations through in-depth metrics and analytics of on-chain user behavior. dApp Marvels will help to attract users to the Polkadot ecosystem more effectively and support Ink! creators in infrastructure development.","A proposal aiming to create a ready to use an analytics platform for all ink! developers, projects and parachains. One of the least contested referendums due to the clarity of the milestones as well as a clear deliverables that would be beneficial for several projects already deploying contracts in the ecosystem.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/118dUGdirM9CIoLZuTwz2waHkY1on2psCOWoIWa8PAYY/edit,https://archive.ph/5hklp,https://archive.ph/06GiD,https://archive.ph/ESiwC,In progress – on time
288,Polkadot System Parachain Collators - Tips Q4/2023,Infrastructure,0,Coinstudio,20 collators,none,1,7289,2023-11-22,,,,,,,,,"Collators on System Parachains are provided with minimal rewards for block production and small incentives in terms of transaction fees. This reduces incentives for Collators to act in a favorable manner and they may also be inclined to under-resourcing their hosts to save costs. Collators should receive funding for the provision of their services. Ultimately, this should be provided by the chain in a preferably sustainable manner. Implementation of such a system is a long-term solution. In the medium term, funding for collators can be provided by the respective Treasuries in the form of a bounty. This allows funding to be pre-allocated and independently managed. This proposal is the final monthly operating costs payment for service providers in Q4 2023. The previous 2-month operation tip was approved under Referenda #156. Future cost compensation will be done under the Polkadot System Parachain Collators Bounty starting from January 2024.","A continuation of the system collators funding, due to the low use of Polkadot’s system parachains, the collators require a subvention for their use. Due to the extreme importance of colators operations, the proposal passed without much resistance.
